# Micro-Reddit
Using Ruby On Rails developed the back-end of reddit using Ruby On Rails on a way smaller scale.

* Focused on generating models with validations and associations.

* Used Rails Console

* Learned a lot about data models and their relationships.

* User, Post, Comment models

* Allow users to be on the site, submit links(Posts), and to comment on them.

* Associations allowed certain relationships like each comment belonging to a user, each post has many comments, and each user has posts and comments.
